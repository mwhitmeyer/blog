I recently finished reading Scott Aaronson's book, <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus.</em> The first thing I will say is that I got a remarkable amount out of reading this book. Even more remakarably, I think this is still true <em>despite</em> various pieces of it flying over my head. One would have to be (in my opinion) a virtual expert in computational complexity, in addition to having a working understanding of the "normal" view/ fundamentals of quantum mechanics in order to get the most possible out of this book. Now, I've got a working understanding (perhaps "exposure" would be a better word) for most of the concepts from classical complexity theory that are brought up, and virtually <em>no</em> understanding of anything about quantum mechanics. The awesome thing about this book is that it was based on Scott's lecture notes for a graduate course that he taught, and he has brilliant and unique ideas and perspectives on these topics, so even for experts you are probably learning something new or at least having your viewpoints challenged. The advanced nature of the book of course comes with the drawback that I would not necessarily describe it as "accessible" to a general audience, and for that reason I am not sure I would recommend the book to anyone who does not at least have an undergraduate background in computer science, or at the very least quantum mechanics.
