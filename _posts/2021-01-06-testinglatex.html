<p>
On this blog you will find a disorganized mix of theoretical computer science and general musings about literally anything else I find interesting. Hence the name of the blog (which is certainly not as clever as I think it is since I came up with it in all of twenty second). A nice diverse potpourri/amalgam/melange of topics is healthy right? Says the guy who finds something he likes and ignores literally everything else. Anyway, this blog is for me, as I venture into the vastly intimidating depths of both theoretical computer science and life. Hopefully this blog keeps me accountable, and will be an accurate log of the important things.

  I'm not too sure why I am writing this post, I doubt that anyone will read it (or this blog in general).
