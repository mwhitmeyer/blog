<h2 class="section-heading">Hi There</h2>
<p>
On this blog you will find a disorganized mix of theoretical computer science and general musings about literally anything else I find interesting. Hence the name of the blog (which is certainly not as clever as I think it is). A nice diverse potpourri/amalgam/melange of topics is healthy right? Says the guy who finds something he likes and ignores literally everything else. Anyway, this blog is for me, as I venture forth into the vast (and intimidating) depths of both theoretical computer science and life. With any luck, this blog will keep me entertained, learning, and accountable.

  I also, clearly, am a fan of Calvin and Hobbes. If you are not familiar, I am not referring to the philosopher and the theologian, but rather the, some might argue far more eloquent, comic strip series by Bill Watterson, which premiered in newspapers between 1985 and 1995 and featured the precocious youth Calvin and his anthropomorphic tiger Hobbes. I am also fond of run-on sentences, so deal with it (or leave), this is my blog. Every post (for the forseeable future) will feature a quote from Calvin and Hobbes that, at least in some convoluted way, has to do with that blog post. For example, I am winging both this blog and my life this year, which is also coincidentally my new year's resolution. So this quote's connection isn't even convoluted!

  Anyway, that's all for now. More substantive posts to come.
