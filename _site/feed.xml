First, James Lee typed up some wonderful notes on parallel repetition, in particular strong parallel repetition, and its connection to the unique games conjecture via max-cut. The latter parts of these notes (and in particular lecture 2) dive into the connections between the odd-cycle game and foams. What are foams? Foams are just tilings of \( \mathbb{R}^d \) by \( \mathbb{Z}^d \) by tiles of unit volume. For example:

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

  I hope to understand this connection with foams a bit better in the future (it's really quite beautiful and clever), but James Lee's notes are already quite nice on this subject, so in this post I am going to talk about Ran Raz's counterexample to strong parallel repetition. But first, what is strong parallel repetition? What is parallel repetition? There's a lot of background to discuss here, and I will discuss it briefly, but if anything is unclear I refer you to the rest of the internet for sufficient background in order to not make this post ridiculously long.
&lt;/p&gt;

Ok, now we are ready to discuss Raz's counterexample to strong parallel repetition. First,
